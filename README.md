# pedetes
Lightweigh PHP library to kickstart multilanguage projects

## how to set up

usually, the pedetes folder is somewhere else than the public http docs. I do use /var/www/libs/pedetes and then have the web docs at /var/www/sites/newSite but that is just personal preference. there will be an blank site example that does use the lib later.

 - curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
 - ./composer.phar self-update
 - ./composer.phar update
